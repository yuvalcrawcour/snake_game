# snake_game
all the relevant code is in main.py.
this project shows my ability to self learn new APIs such as pygame, 
and the ability to take control over the logic behind the program,
which in this case includes classes and interactions between them, loops and if statments and the use of a linked list data structure.
basicaly the snake game is happening on a grid and the fruits and the snake are made of squares.
the snake is inplemented as a a linked list of nodes.
the project containts comments, i hope it helps to understand what the code means.
if you have any questions you can contact me at yuvalcrawcour@gmail.com
